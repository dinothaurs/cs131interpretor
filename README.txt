An Interpreter written in Python containing of 4 parts.

Part 1:  A basic interpreter for the Brewin language(a made up language) with basic main, print, and input abilities.

Part 2: Building off of Part 1 but now Brewin can run any self defined function and recursion.

Part 3: Building off of Part 2 and code provided by Professor Nachenberg, Brewin is now Brewin++ (kind of similar to C++), can now support structures, coercions, and uses static typing. 

Part 4: Building off of Part 2, Brewin is now Brewin+; it supports need semantics and lazy evaluation, contains exception handling, and short circuting.
