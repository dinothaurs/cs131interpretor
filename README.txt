Missing 4 test cases, I think the problem is with my scoping and dealing with variables 
when it becomes more complicated and there are more returns or functions calls or 
if/for statements. I know a specific problem is in the next returns where if there's a for
loop and a nested if with a return, it can't catch that because of the way my returns are 
implemented. Hope to fix that in future TT^TT
